Read and comment the paper Do we Need Hundreds of Classifiers to Solve Real World Classification Problems?

In the paper, the pursue is to select the best classifier for the selected data set collection, to rank each classifier and family according to its accuracy, to determine, for each classifier, its probability of achieving the best accuracy, and the difference between its accuracy and the best one and to evaluate the classifier behavior varying the data set properties. For this achieve this, the researchers use 112 data sets from the UCI machine learning repository to evaluate 179 classifiers. 

The use of classification methods depends on the fields of the researcher himself, and often the researcher expects “the best” of the method he uses given that he does not know more about other “classifier families”. However, it is possible to implement a large collection of classifiers and achieve important conclusions within the data and find the best classifier. In the paper, the researchers try to show the reader about the accuracy of the methods of classification in different software, which is very important to minimize the problem mentioned above about the partiality for the use of certain methods that responses frequently to the little knowledge of all the classifiers methods available. 

The paper is very useful for researchers in general, but mostly is useful to those who are learning about classification and machine learning. It gives a little introduction to these areas, and it shows some of the features of the most significant classification methods, so they can be implemented in real-world problems.
